About
=====

This project provides a starting point for integrating the Brightcove Media API into your application. It provides simple ways to interact with the API.

This project relies on the [Brightcove Commons open source libraries](https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/Java-Commons).

Documentation

Downloads
=========

**Version 4.0.3**:

This version uses the new major release of the Brightcove Commons libraries.
This allows both the read and write api to specify an HttpClientFactory, which
can dictate how HttpClients are created each time a method is called.

This is especially necessary if a user wishes to use https instead of http to
communicate with the Media API.
